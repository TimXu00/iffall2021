</p>I've been duckin' my friends, I've been stuck on my ends</p>
</p>Memories about people all in my head</p>
</p>First come to mind is my mama buyin' me Jordans</p>
</p>Are we really made equal? 'Cause everybody got plans</p>
</p>I can't go ghost, I face demons</p>
</p>Don't let it defeat you, all in my hands</p>
</p>I know it's hard for you to come out that trance</p>
</p>I look myself in the mirror when I can</p>
</p>Let's speak the truth, tell me in pieces</p>
</p>I know it's you, I know just what you do</p>
</p>I knew since we first got evicted out our roof</p>
</p>Might knew since rehab, I was six, tryna see you</p>
</p>How could I resent you? Demons and tissue</p>
</p>Grandma and I missed you</p>
</p>You don't know what we've been through</p>
</p>Don't let the wolves come get you</p>
</p>Please don't let them come get you</p>
</p>How could I resent you? Demons and tissue</p>
</p>Grandma and I missed you</p>
</p>You don't know what we've been through</p>
</p>Don't let the wolves come get you</p>
</p>Please don't let them come get you</p>
</p>Run away from home, run away from home</p>
</p>When the night's gone, when the night's gone</p>
</p>Run away from home, run away from home-ome-ome-ome-ome</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all seem to be convinced?</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all question my exit?</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all livin' on the fence?</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why I'm sleepin' on it?</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why it get me so upset?</p>
</p>Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all want me dead?</p>
</p>Why you listen to the demons in your head?</p>
</p>Why do we play victim? Good times are ahead</p>
</p>Attention, this is my life sentence, huh, huh</p>
</p>You're committed, huh, defensive 'bout your vision, huh, huh</p>
</p>Don't you get offended, huh</p>
</p>When the darkness hits, I'll show you all that I'm not kiddin', huh</p>
</p>Grow a tree, plant the seed, let it breathe</p>
</p>My sister RiRi only see me on the screen</p>
</p>I know she needs me, I can't help but feel T</p>
</p>How could I resent you? Demons and tissue</p>
</p>Grandma and I missed you</p>
</p>You don't know what we've been through</p>
</p>Don't let the wolves come get you</p>
</p>Please don't let them come get you</p>
</p>How could I resent you? Demons and tissue</p>
</p>Grandma and I missed you</p>
</p>You don't know what we've been through</p>
</p>Don't let the wolves come get you</p>
</p>Please don't let them come get you</p>
